 # Mechanoreceptor: Ultimate Browser-Based Game Input Library

 ## 1. Core Architecture

 ### 1.1 TypeScript Foundation
 - Develop the entire library in TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
 - Compile to ES6+ JavaScript for modern browsers
 - Provide type definitions for easy integration in TypeScript projects

 ### 1.2 Module Structure
 - Use ES6 modules for better code organization and tree-shaking
 - Implement a main entry point that allows importing only needed components

 ### 1.3 Browser API Utilization
 - Leverage modern browser APIs for input handling:
   - KeyboardEvent for keyboard input
   - MouseEvent and PointerEvent for mouse/touch input
   - Gamepad API for gamepad support

 ### 1.4 Input Abstraction Layer
 - Create an `InputSource` interface to standardize different input methods
 - Implement concrete classes: `KeyboardSource`, `MouseSource`, `TouchSource`, `GamepadSource`

 ### 1.5 Event-Driven Architecture
 - Utilize browser's event system as the foundation
 - Implement a custom event emitter for internal library events

 ## 2. Input Handling

 ### 2.1 Keyboard Input
 - Handle `keydown`, `keyup`, and `keypress` events
 - Implement key mapping to account for different keyboard layouts
 - Support simultaneous key presses and complex key combinations

 ### 2.2 Mouse Input
 - Handle `mousemove`, `mousedown`, `mouseup`, `click`, `dblclick` events
 - Implement pointer lock API for FPS-style mouse control
 - Support mouse wheel events for scrolling/zooming

 ### 2.3 Touch Input
 - Utilize `TouchEvent` for multi-touch support
 - Implement basic gesture recognition (swipe, pinch, rotate)
 - Ensure compatibility with both touch-only and hybrid devices

 ### 2.4 Gamepad Input
 - Use Gamepad API to detect and interact with connected gamepads
 - Handle button presses, analog stick movement, and triggers
 - Implement polling for consistent gamepad state updates

 ## 3. Input Mapping System

 ### 3.1 JSON-based Mapping Configuration
 - Define a JSON schema for input mappings
 - Allow loading of custom mapping configurations
 - Implement default mappings for common game genres

 ### 3.2 Dynamic Remapping
 - Create a UI component for real-time key rebinding
 - Implement conflict resolution for overlapping mappings
 - Store custom mappings in localStorage or IndexedDB

 ### 3.3 Context-Sensitive Mappings
 - Support different mapping profiles for various game states (e.g., menu, gameplay)
 - Allow easy switching between mapping contexts

 ## 4. Command Pattern Implementation

 ### 4.1 Command Interface
 - Define a `Command` interface for all game actions
 - Implement concrete command classes for various game actions

 ### 4.2 Input-Command Binding
 - Create a flexible system to bind input events to commands
 - Support one-to-many and many-to-one bindings

 ### 4.3 Command Queue
 - Implement a command queue for handling rapid inputs
 - Allow for command prioritization and cancellation

 ## 5. Advanced Features

 ### 5.1 Combo System
 - Develop a timing-based system for detecting input combinations
 - Allow definition of complex input sequences

 ### 5.2 Input Buffer
 - Implement an adjustable input buffer to handle timing-sensitive inputs
 - Provide options to configure buffer size and duration

 ## 6. Performance Optimization

 ### 6.1 Efficient Event Handling
 - Use event delegation to minimize the number of event listeners
 - Implement throttling and debouncing for high-frequency events (e.g., mousemove)

 ### 6.2 Web Workers Integration
 - Offload heavy computation to Web Workers
 - Use SharedArrayBuffer for fast communication between main thread and workers (where supported)

 ### 6.3 Memory Management
 - Implement proper cleanup mechanisms to prevent memory leaks
 - Use WeakMap and WeakSet for caching without preventing garbage collection

 ## 7. Cross-Browser Compatibility

 ### 7.1 Browser Feature Detection
 - Use feature detection instead of browser detection
 - Implement fallbacks for unsupported features

 ### 7.2 Polyfills
 - Include necessary polyfills for older browsers
 - Make polyfills optional for projects targeting modern browsers only

 ## 8. Integration and API

 ### 8.1 Framework-Agnostic Core
 - Design the core library to be usable with any JavaScript framework or vanilla JS

 ### 8.2 Framework Adapters
 - Develop optional adapters for popular frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
 - Provide examples of integration with common game engines (Phaser, Three.js)

 ### 8.3 Public API
 - Design a clean, intuitive API for easy integration
 - Implement method chaining for a fluent interface

 ## 9. Testing and Quality Assurance

 ### 9.1 Unit Testing
 - Use Jest for unit testing
 - Aim for high test coverage, especially for core functionality

 ### 9.2 Integration Testing
 - Implement integration tests using Cypress or Playwright
 - Test across multiple browsers and devices

 ## 10. Documentation and Examples

 ### 10.1 API Documentation
 - Generate API docs using TypeDoc
 - Host documentation on GitHub Pages

 ### 10.2 Usage Guides
 - Create comprehensive guides for common use cases
 - Provide interactive examples using CodeSandbox or similar platforms

 ### 10.3 Demo Games
 - Develop simple demo games showcasing library capabilities
 - Cover different genres to demonstrate versatility

 ## 11. Deployment and Distribution

 ### 11.1 Package Management
 - Publish the library on npm
 - Provide a CDN link for direct browser inclusion

 ### 11.2 Build Process
 - Use Rollup or Webpack for bundling
 - Provide both minified and non-minified builds
